      <p class="blurb">I am a recent transplant to Austin from New York City.  My primary interests 
        include coding, food, nature, and travel.  This blog is a chance for me to build
          my skills as a developer while discussing some of my favorite topics.</p>

    	<h2>About Me</h2>
    </section>

    <section>
    	<p>I guess the best place to start is the beginning.  I was born and 
      raised in Southern California.  My parents were amazing and kept me very active,
      involved, and well-rounded.  The enrolled me in soccer, t-ball, piano lessons, and
      made sure that I completed my homework every night.  We were very involved in the church
      community, as well.  When my dad got a job transfer to New Mexico when I was 14, I was
      devastated by the thought of leaving everything, and everyone, that I had ever known.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>My dad's job took us to Los Alamos, New Mexico, which is where the Los Alamos National
      Labs are located.  This is where the atomic bomb was built that was launched all the way 
      back in WWII.  High school was extremely competitive, with most students being children of
      scientists.  I got involved in Spanish Club, ran cross country, was student body secretary,
      and travelled to Europe for 20 days.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I ended up doing very well in school, graduating with a 4.3 thanks to the many AP courses I
      took.  I chose UC Santa Barbara as my college because I loved the feel of the campus, and it
      is a very social school.  I was a huge nerd at this point, acne and all, and needed to develop
      some social skills.  College definitely opened me up.  Living with 6 people in a tiny house, you
      have no choice except to be outgoing and curious about others.  I double majored in Business
      Economics and Political Science, which I thought would have me set me up for life.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>After graduating, I moved all the way across the country to New York City.  I had a handful of
      friends there and was ready for a fresh start.  I was lucky enough to get a good job in finance
      within three days of moving to the city.  I worked as a trader for a small investment advisory
      firm in midtown for two years, but I had a lot going on internally.  At this point, I finally
      accepted that I was gay and very unhappy with my current state of affairs.  I had what I like to
      call my quarter life crisis where I left my finance job, jumped in to my first serious relationship,
      and began working in the service industry</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Working in the service industry was surprisingly really satisfying.  The money was amazing, I
      made some lifelong friends, and had enough freedom to travel and really enjoy life for the first
      time.  I stayed in that position for 7 years, way too long, until my coworkers boyfriend hired me to
      become a staffing manager for his staffing agency.  This job was a crazy whirlwind of growth, stress,
      and insanity.  I worked 80 hours a week managing client requests and overseeing staff bookings and
      cancellations.  After that, I moved on to a similar position with a catering company that recently
      had picked up two of the largest venues in Midtown Manhattan.  I pushed through the grind again, but
      alas, the company raised prices, and we lost the big accounts.  I was part of a large layoff,
      where about 30% of the company was let go.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>I realized at this point that I was still very unhappy with my life.  It became clear to me that
      I rarely made decisions for myself and let my conditions be dictated by those around me.  As opposed
      to staying in NYC, which I was no longer in love with, I made the move to Austin for another fresh
      start (I guess this can be called my mid-life crisis).  Being in Austin has inspired me to take control
      and move my career in a new direction.  I always loved school, so I have joined a coding bootcamp to gain
      experience towards becoming a full-stack developer.  I am in the beginning stages of this process,
      but I already feel that making this choice for myself is the right decision.  This blog is my
      first attempt to put my newfound knowledge to the test.  Fingers crossed it goes well, haha!</p>
