      <p class="blurb">I am a recent transplant to Austin from New York City.  My primary interests 
        include coding, food, nature, and travel.  This blog is a chance for me to build
          my skills as a developer while discussing some of my favorite topics.</p>

    	<h2>Welcome to my Blog!</h2>
    	<p>Hi!  My name is David and I am a recent transplant to Austin from New York City, which was home
    	for the past thirteen years.  Prior to that, I went to school at the University of California at Santa Barbara,
    	spent a brief four years in New Mexico, and was raised in Orange County, California.  While I thought I would have
        things figured out at this point in my life, a lot of things are still up in the air.  I have recent decided
        to learn to code and am currently enrolled in a bootcamp.  For a more in depth dive into my life, feel free to checkout my <a href="about-me.html">about me</a> page.</p>
