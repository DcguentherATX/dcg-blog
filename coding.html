      <p>Week three presented many challenges that I had not previously experienced.  The week began
      with the continuation of Underbar.  Part two was a deeper dive into the more complex functions
      in Underbar, including memoize, extend, defaults, and delay.  These functions required a more
      solid grasp on concepts such as scopes, closures, and the <em>'this'</em> keyword.</p>

      <p>My partner and I were not on the same page for this portion of the class, which created
      additional complications in coding and communication.  We both relied on different implementations
      to create our basic code and thus were lost in translation on many applications.  Once we
      reached the advanced problems, we were both mentally exhausted, questioning our abilities, and
      frustrated with the process.</p>

      <p>On Wednesday, we switched partners and began the Testbuilder sprint.  This was an easier sprint
      that dove into the application of IIFE's that helped us write code that could write other code.
      The premise was to take in a random string, test it's length and prefix, and make sure that it
      matched a particular credit card company.  It started out easy, with only a handful of prefix
      numbers and lengths, but by the end, we had to test thousands of credit card numbers, 3328 to be
      exact.</p>

      <p>We eventually discovered that we couldn't hard code the problem and needed to create helper functions
      to construct the strings.  In addition, to test every single possible option, we had to use
      IIFE's, which are immediately invoked functions.  Thankfully, there was a helpful hint in how
      to use these included in the testbuilder program.  Upon completing this sprint, I felt very
      accomplished in comparison to the feeling of defeat on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>The week ended with a spring on front end development.  I was very excited about this, as I had
      played with HTML and CSS before and was looking forward to diving in deeper.  I was surprised to
      discover that the sprint focused minimally on HTML and CSS and focused primarily on learning 
      a new library, JQuery.  While JQuery is very cool and can do amazing things, there was a lot
      to read and there was practically no direction on how to complete the task.  As of now, I have almost
      completed the sprint with a lot of copy and past formatting.  I only have one small issue, in which
      I am supposed to add squares with new colors to a larger box, and my square additions are all
      added in blue.</p>

      <p>At the end of week 3, I feel like I have learned a lot, but still have a long way to go.  This weekend
      I plan on reading up on JQuery, completing some more Underbar part two problems, ramping up my
      comprehension of closures (we had a pop quiz on Friday), completing some toy problems, practicing
      working with Snippets, coding in the console, and researching recursion.  I did have some office
      hours on Wednesday, in which I was told to get ahead on recursion as it is a complicated concept.
      Due to my issues with closure and <em>'this'</em>, the instructor recommended that I get ahead.</p>

      <p>So much to do and so little time.  This the day long assessment looming in the not so distant future,
      I am nervous that I am not prepared to pass the test at this point.  Time feels limited and I 
      am very stressed.  At the end of the day, I am not sure if I'll be able to get where I need to be.</p>

      <p>Week to of the HRext program started out well.  I quickly became more comfortable working
      with my new laptop and jumped right into pair-programming.  Zoom worked perfectly and we were
      able to complete all of the advanced content in a timely manner.</p>

      <p>My partner for the first two days was Johnny, who lives in Washington State.  He was very
      friendly and outgoing.  Our challenge on day one was to plan out test for high order functions
      based on the provided names.  For example, for filter, we had to figure out what tests would
      prove that a scripted function was working properly.  We came up with a plan to test if filter
      pulled out all even numbers from an array.  We performed this task for 25 functions from the
      Underscore library.</p>

      <p>The second day that we were paired together, we were assigned the task of writing the test
      functions that we theorized over the day before.  It was the same function list, and we used
      Mocha and Chai to test our functions.  At this point, some of the class was asking about Sinon
      with its spy and stub capabilities.  Sinon is a test suite that is compatible with other test
      suites that allows you to perform additional tests.  Despite my additional research, I was not
      able to figure out how Sinon worked in conjunction with Mocha and Chai.</p>

      <p>The third and fourth day of the week, I switched pairs and worked with Kim who lives in the
      Bay Area in California.  She was sweet and friendly, and had a strong method for tackling each
      problem.  Our task was to write the functions so that they would pass all of the tests that
      were included in the Underbar library that had been created by the previous cohort.  Once complete,
      we moved onto the advanced content of writing tests and functions for additional high order functions.</p>

      <p>I found that I enjoyed pair programming, as it forced me to think through my code, what
      expectations I had for code that I wrote, and how to eloquently communicate about the tests and
      functions that I was drafting.  I also felt more comfortable in my abilities as I felt like
      I was on par, or a little ahead, of my pairs.  In addition, I was exposed to some more advanced
      material, such as how to use the arguments object and how to scribe functions that take in
      different types of collections (arrays and objects).</p>

      <p>Friday was primarily a lecture day where we were introduced to the concepts of scopes and
      closures.  Scopes seemed naturally intuitive as we had already been writing functions that 
      required knowledge of how global vs. local scopes work.  Closures were a little bit more
      confusing, as we were not exposed to authoring functions within functions.  I am still a little
      fuzzy on this concept and need more practice on some real problems.  Finally, we were exposed
      to the <i>this</i> keyword.  This refers to a possessive object or function.  The
      lecture was extremely confusing and I spent most of the evening researching how this can
      be used.  By the time I went to bed, I felt like I had that figured out.</p>

      <p>In sum, I felt very confident in my skills throughout most of the week.  With the introduction
      of the new concepts on Friday, I definitely need some additional time and work before I would
      consider myself a master of those skills.  I am hoping that we get more direction on these
      subject matters, as they are a more complicated than they first appear.  At the end of my second
      week, I feel like I have levelled up in many ways, but am still wary of my JavaScript coding
      abilities.</p>

    	<h6>March 2, 2019</h6>
    	<p>This is my first official post on my blog!  Yay!  I am one week in to an 18 week full-stack
    	web-development program here in Austin and would like to post about my experience.   This week
    	has been a confirmation that I have a long way to go.  To enter the program, I had to prove that
    	I had basic JavaScript programming knowledge.  This week, we focused on learning about git and 
    	GitHub, thinking like an engineer, testing and koans, and pair programming.  I feel like I have
    	held my own throughout the week, however, there have definitely been some challenges.</p>

    	<p>What I find the most challenging is the pace.  Class is 8 hours a day, but we can cover up to
    	two major programming concepts in a single day.  Once we have a lecture, we immediately jump
    	directly into applying our new knowledge.  It is very exciting to learn so quickly, but also 
    	feels like you never quite know exactly what to do.  As the week progressed, directions provided
    	more and more ambiguity.</p>

      <p>My biggest challenge for the week occured yesterday, as my old laptop which I purchased in
      2012 crashed in the middle of our pair programming sprint.  I felt helpless and alone sitting
      in my apartment and being unable to communicate with my assigned partner, the TA's, and my 
      instructors.  I dashed off to Apple and purchased a new computer, which I am currently working
      on at this moment.
      </p>

      <p>The biggest problem with this occuring during class time is that now I don't know how to pair
      program and I have missed all the afternoon content from the course.  The course moves very
      quickly, so this could be detrimental to my progress.  I was able to complete all of the paired
      problems on my own, but have not been able to push them to GitHub as I don't have editing
      abilities on my joint project.  Hopefully this all gets sorted out on Monday.</p>

      <p>After my first week, I definitely feel like I need more education on high order functions,
      such as map, filter, reduce, and some.  There were also some problems in the koans sprint that
      involved prototypes and constructors, which I have zero knowledge on.  We also were introduced
      to debugging in the console, which I am trying to catch up on this weekend.</p>

      <p>I will say that the community that I am a part of is amazing.  I do feel supported not only
      by the TA's and help desk, but also with my peers.  Austin appears to have a large group of
      students, and several have already met up in person to study.  I would definitely like to join
      a study group next week.</p>

      <p>In sum, the first week has been educational, challenging, and stressful.  I feel like I
      fall somewhere in the middle of the class with my peers.  My fear is that as the course gets
      more challenging, I will fall behind the others.  I have placed a lot on being successful in
      this course, and hope that things continue to go well (and hopefully get a little better).</p>
